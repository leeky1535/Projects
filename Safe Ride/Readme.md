Safe Ride

This is our Safe Ride project.

We used Django Web Framework to build our website.

We use MySQL for our databases.

Our website 'Safe Ride' uses Chicago Crimes Data provided by Chicago Police Department to provide customers with searching, adding, removing functions of crimes data in Chicago. Our website also has log-in authentification. For advanced functions we implemented graphs tables and mapping of crimes data for visualization.
